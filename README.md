# rimphony

This is a reimplementation of the
[Symphony](https://github.com/AFD-Illinois/symphony) synchrotron coefficient
code in the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) language.

Testing indicates that the code works well but it is still in development. You
are encouraged to use Symphony if possible, citing
[Pandya et al (2016)](https://dx.doi.org/10.3847/0004-637X/822/1/34) and
[Leung et al (2011)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/737/1/21).

I ([PKGW](https://newton.cx/~peter/)) wrote this version to help me understand
Symphony better, to try out Rust as a language for scientific programming, and
because I thought that writing the program in Rust would make it a bit easier
to experiment with some new features, such as pitch-angle dependences in the
electron distribution functions. I feel that that is indeed the case.

## Structure

The layout of the files in this repository follows standard Rust practices.

- The `gsl-sys` subdirectory contains a subproject that implements some minimal
  bindings to the [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) numerics library.
- The `leung-bessel` subdirectory contains a subproject that provides access
  to the fast Bessel function evaluator described in AppendixÂ B of
  [Leung et al (2011)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0004-637X/737/1/21).
- The `src` subdirectory contains the main code.
- The `tests` subdirectory contains some simple tests.
- The `benches` subdirectory contains some minimal benchmarking code.
